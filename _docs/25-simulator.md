### Roast Simulator

*Menu>Tools>Simulator*

[COMING IN RELEASE 2.4](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan/blob/master/wiki/ReleaseHistory.md)

Simulator allows you test features such as Extra Devices, LCD settings, talking events and a wide variety of settings by using a previous roast to simulate a current roast.  For example, if you use talking alarms, you may not get the syntax and other choices correct when setting up your events.  With Simulator you can run a test without actually roast.  

When you choose Menu>Tools>Simulator a dialog will open to choose a roast.  Hit Start and off you go.
