Dear All, 

Thx for havin me here in your comunity. 

My Setup ist as follows: Probatone 12 and Artisan V. XX.XXX.xXX running on iMac with latest OS Big Sur 11.6

Now since a few Weeks my Artisan Crashes when I start a Roast. The Software close itself an reboot itself but starts a new Session.

In the log I got the Rext: MODBUS Connection Error
Straight after reebooting the software there ist the Message: MODBUS Connection restored.

Does anyone of you have an idea where the Problem could be?

regards
Patrick
