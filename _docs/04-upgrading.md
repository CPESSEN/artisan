## Upgrading Artisan

Download and install the latest version of [Artisan](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan/releases/latest).

The installer, on a MAC or PC, will first remove your prior version but this wonâ€™t remove your prior settings if you have them. You can also downgrade to a previous version by just uninstalling the current version and re-installing the old version without losing any settings.    

To ensure you have no issues when modifying settings or upgrading, please save your stable settings first (`Help` >> `Save Settings`).

## A note on upgrading to 2.0 from v1.x:

Artisan 2 stores the application settings in a new location. On the initial start up of Artisan 2 the old settings are imported. From that moment on, changes to settings done with Artisan 2 will not be synchronized automatically back to previous versions. However, synchronizing settings via save/load settings (under menu Help) manually works across all versions. PLEASE EXPORT a working SETTINGS FILE and keep it saved to be able to track back in case changes do not work out as expected when upgrading.

More complete instructions on the [Installation](https://artisan-scope.org/docs/installation/) page.
