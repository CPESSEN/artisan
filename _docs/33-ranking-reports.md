### Ranking Reports

Menu>File>Report>Ranking

For comparing your roasts, a great feature is Report>Ranking>.
You can save these reports in a web page format, a CSV or an Excel format.  Use your computers normal method for selecting multiple files at once when the dialog box pops open to load a profile.  

This is the web version and itâ€™s hard to screen shot, but you get Load, Charge Temp, FC start time, FC temp, Drop time, Drop Temp, Dry %, Mai%, Dev%, AUC, and Loss.
