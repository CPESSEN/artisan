### Controls

Menu: `View` >> `Controls`

This toggles on the top line of controls on the right:
![View Controls](/assets/images/gsg/view menu controls.png)

These controls need to be visible to operate Artisan.  

Menu `View` >> `Readings` toggles the standard temperature readings on the right side, on and off.

To toggle the Buttons and Sliders on and off that you configured under [Events](https://artisan-scope.org/docs/events/) navigate to:

Menu>View>Buttons

Menu>View>Sliders
